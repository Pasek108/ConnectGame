  <summary>❓Why my commits often have no names and I'm not using branches❓</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I often create with bursts many things at once</li>
    <li>I don't plan things ahead, I just create things that seems good at that moment</li>
    <li>Sometimes I have bad internet connection and it is troublesome to send commits</li>
    <li>I'm coding alone so creating branches and describing commits is not useful for me</li>

### Features
- Menu background animation
- Four game modes:
  - Squares (with 3 levels of difficulty) - moving and rotating blocks to make all of them correctly connected to each other
  - Bridges - connecting all islands together with horizontal and vertical bridges that cannot cross each other but islands have limited bridges that can connect to them
  - Pipes - rotating pipes to connect all endpoints to the source
  - Sliders - sliding rows or columns of pipes to connect all endpoints to the source
- Three game mode levels editors:
  - Squares
  - Bridges
  - Pipes and Sliders (both use the same editor)
- Genarting random levels for:
  - Squares
  - Pipes and Sliders
- Multiple languages:
  - Polish
  - English

> [!NOTE]  
> Room for improvements:
> - In-game instruction about game modes
> - Bridges game mode levels generator
> - Creating at least 200, increasingly harder levels for game modes and their difficulties
> - Improving responsiveness on mobile devices
> - Adding more game modes (eg. Flow Free, 1 LINE)
> - Adding more languages
> - Multiplayer

----------------------------------

### Setup
Ways to run this program: 
1. Use the [live demo](https://tic-tac-toe-alqu.onrender.com)
2. Follow the same steps as for editing the program

To edit this program:
- Download this repo
- Download and install Python
- Run app.py file
- Install [Prepros](https://prepros.io)
- Add this project in Prepros
- Create config.py file in project folder
- Run this code in some online Python IDE
  - *import secrets*
  - *print(secrets.token_hex(16))*
- Put generated string in config.py eg. *SECRET_KEY = "generated_string"*
- Start coding

## Details
This section is a general description of the project required to understand how it works, the exact details are in the code or simply are the code.

### User interface
#### Every page
On every page there is: 
- Header:
  - Title which is a link to the main menu page
  - Language selection box that allows the user to change the language of the page without reloading
- Footer
  - Link to my github

#### Main menu
![main menu](/_for_readme/main_menu.png)
Main menu is basically a form for creating a game.

Click on the multiplayer option will take the player to the multiplayer lobby.<br>
Click on the back option will take the player to the previous step.<br>

![main menu](/_for_readme/main_menu_steps.png)
Creating a game is a 3-step form:
1. Enemy (AI or player on the same device) and game mode
2. Starting player and type of game (standard, reversed)
3. Board size, players marks, changing sides every game

----------------------------------

#### Multiplayer lobby
![multiplayer_lobby](/_for_readme/multi_lobby.png)
The lobby shows all existing games in the form of a list of rooms that the player can join or create a new one. When there is no players in the room, the room is deleted. If the room is full player can't join until some place becomes available. In that case the join button is disabled. Rooms protected by password has a join button with a lock icon. After clicking it player has to put the correct password in order to join to the game.

Each of the rooms in the lobby has:
- Unique ID
- Name consisting of:
  - Mode
  - Players marks
  - Board size
  - Type of a game
- Number of players in the room
- Join button

Creating a game is similar to creating a game in the main menu. The difference is that it is packed in one form and has option for setting password.

Player has to choose:
- Game mode
- Board size
- Type (uncheck = standard, check = reversed)
- Password (empty = no password)
- Players marks
- Starting player
- Switching sides every game

----------------------------------

#### Game
![game](/_for_readme/onemark_game.png)


----------------------------------

#### Multiplayer game
![multiplayer_game](/_for_readme/multi_game.png)
Games in multiplayer are the same as normal games but on the bottom there is a room id and button to copy a link for someone to join a room. 
Password is passed in the URL.

If there is no other player or player left the game, its position will be hilighted in red color and game will be stopped on waiting for enemy player to making a move.
If both players leave the game then te romm and its game is deleted.

### Code organization

![program diagram](/_for_readme/program_diagram.png)

> [!WARNING]
