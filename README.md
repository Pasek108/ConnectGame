  <summary>❓Why my commits often have no names and I'm not using branches❓</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I often create with bursts many things at once</li>
    <li>I don't plan things ahead, I just create things that seems good at that moment</li>
    <li>Sometimes I have bad internet connection and it is troublesome to send commits</li>
    <li>I'm coding alone so creating branches and describing commits is not useful for me</li>
